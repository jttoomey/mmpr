			<h2>Bio</h2>
      <h3>Tommy Oliver</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="img/tommyg.jpg" alt="bio">
			<p>Tommy is initially the most powerful of the Power Rangers. He received his Green Ranger power while under the spell of Rita. He was saved by the Power Rangers from a life serving the Evil Empress and joined them to fight on the side of good.

Using his formidable martial arts skills and his Power Shield, Tommy was always there to help out the Power Rangers when things got tough. That is until through treachery, Rita and Goldar managed to cause Tommy to lose his powers.

After a while Tommy was once again called on to help the Power Rangers and was powered by Zordon, but his powers are only temporary and they faded away over time.

Tommy draws his power from the Dragon. His weapon is the Dragon Dagger.</p>

			<h2>Weapon</h2>
				<h3>Dragon Dagger</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="img/dragondagger.png" alt="weapon">
			<p>This is the personal weapon of the Green Ranger. It is used to summon and control the Dragonzord by playing it like a flute, anyone who has the Dragon Dagger can summon Dragonzord from the Ocean. Once Tommy lost his power the Dagger was put into storage in the Command Center along with The Dragon Power until it was stolen by Billy while under the control of Rita and given to Goldar. After Tommy's powers were restored by Zordon he later reclaimed the dagger and kept it as his primary weapon until his powers were fully drained by Lord Zedd and coin and dagger disintegrated.</p>

			<h2>Zord</h2>
			<h3>Dragon</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="img/dragonzord.jpg" alt="zord">
			<p>The Dragonzord lay dormant in the sea off the coast of Angel Grove for an indeterminate number of years. After creating her evil Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa gave him the Dragon Dagger, granting him the power to summon and control the Dragonzord. When her spell was broken and Tommy joined the Power Rangers on the side of good, he retained the dagger and control of Dragonzord. Eventually, Tommy's powers were completely drained, and the Dragonzord returned to stasis in the sea. It returned to its watery slumber one final time and was not seen again.</p>
