      <h3>Tommy Oliver</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="tommyw.jpg" alt="bio">
			<p>After losing his green ranger powers, Tommy was swimming at the lake one afternoon and a beam of light surrounded him. He was teleported to the Command Center. Zordon and Alpha revealed their plans to him of creating a new Ranger, and because this Ranger would be created from the White Light of Good, it would be impossible for the darkness to control him. Tommy was the perfect candidate to take on the powers for his bravery and determination from his old Ranger days. When the other Rangers were teleported to the Command Center, Tommy revealed himself to be the new White Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger. Upon his introduction to the rest of the team, Zordon announced that Tommy would become the new leader of the Power Rangers. Tommy draws his new powers from the White Tiger. His new weapon is the talking short sword saba. </p>

			<h2>Weapon</h2>
				<h3>Saba</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="saba.jpg" alt="weapon">
			<p>This is the personal weapon of the White Ranger. Saba is an enchanted short sword. He had the ability to talk, project energy blasts from his eyes, and can fly. Saba also controls the White Tigerzord, and inserting him into the control panel of the Zord allowes him to change into warrior mode. In this mode, Saba can take orders from Tommy, to include having the Zord emulate his movements. If stolen, however, Saba could be controlled by anyone (though against the sword's will).</p>

			<h2>Zord</h2>
			<h3>White Tiger</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="tigerzord.jpg" alt="zord">
			<p>With the creation of the White Power Ranger, Zordon gave Tommy the new White Tiger zord. Tommy summons and controls the Zord with his talking short sword, Saba.

Tommy had trouble controlling the Zord at first, but eventually got past it. The Zord has two forms.  The Tiger mode is the primary form that the Tiger zord takes when entering battle. It can not only move fast, but can emit powerful sonic blasts at opponents. The primary fighting form, Warrior mode is equipped with a sword, and can fire powerful "White Tiger Thunderbolts" in the form of energy fireballs at his opponents. It has also demonstrated the ability to follow the White Ranger's every move.</p>
