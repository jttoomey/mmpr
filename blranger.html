			<h2>Bio</h2>
      <h3>Billy Cranston</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="billy.jpg" alt="bio">
			<p>Billy is an ultra-intelligent kid who at times has trouble communicating with his peers. Many consider him a nerd, until they get to know him. The fact is, Billy is a sweet, good-hearted super-genius, who has focused entirely on academics. He often talks in techno-speak, using complicated language that only Trini seems to understand.

He belongs to the debate team, the science club, the math club, and the chess club. Billy is fascinated by the world around him and has a deep need to know how everything works. In spite of his intelligence Billy is shy and reserved, except when he is with his fellow Power Rangers. It is with them that he feels at home and free to be himself.

Billy draws power from the Triceratops. His weapon is the Power Lance.</p>

			<h2>Weapon</h2>
				<h3>Power Lance</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="powerlance.png" alt="weapon">
			<p>This is the personal weapon of the Blue Ranger. A double-bladed lance that is close in height to the Blue Ranger itself, it can split into a pair of trident-like sai blades, the size of escrima sticks. When used as a part of the Power Blaster, it forms two of the five laser barrels. Billy calls his weapon the Mighty Maces. It can generate electricity.</p>

			<h2>Zord</h2>
			<h3>Triceratops</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="triceratopszord.jpg" alt="zord">
			<p>The Triceratops zord forms the left leg of the Megazord and Dragonzord Battle Mode. When on its own it can shoot laser shots from its twin cannon tail. It can fire chain-link power cables out of its horns to subdue opponents as well. The Triceratops remains in the desert when not in use.</p>
