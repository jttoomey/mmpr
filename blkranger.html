			<p>Zack is a kid in love with life. He is everybody's friend and lights up a room when he enters it. He's also a kid with a good heart and a seemingly boundless supply of energy. He is smooth talking, streetwise, very clever and has the ability to disarm his adversaries with a quick smile and a smooth line. He fancies himself to be a ladies man.

        Zack's passion in life is music and dance. He is also an accomplished gymnast, a skill which he combines with dancing and martial arts to form a karate style he calls Hip Hop Kido. Zack draws his power from the Mastodon. His weapon is the Power Axe.</p>
