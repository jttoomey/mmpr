			<h2>Bio</h2>
      <h3>Jason Lee Scott</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="jason.jpg" alt="bio">
			<p>Jason is a seventeen year old black belt in karate and the leader of the team, he is serious about his martial arts and spends much of his time working out new moves and perfecting old ones. The remainder of his time is spent on schoolwork and hanging out with his friends, like most other kids of his age.

He is a patriotic sort of guy who is very much into the idea of being a superhero and saving the world. He is, however, first and foremost, a teenager with all the ups and downs and hopes and dreams that go along with his age. Sometimes, his sly smile betrays his rugged young warrior mantle to reveal a kid next door with a mischievous streak. Jason draws his power from Tyrannosaurus Rex. His weapon is the Power Sword.</p>

			<h2>Weapon</h2>
				<h3>Power Sword</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="powersword.jpg" alt="weapon">
			<p>This is the personal weapon of the Red Ranger. When used as part of the Power Blaster, it is placed on top of it, the blade pointing towards the barrel. Zordon stated that it is the key to all the weapons' powers. Jason does not give his weapon a second name as the others do. It is also the only weapon that does not have a second function. It can use a devastating slash of energy when the Red Ranger runs two of his fingers on his Sword and send it at his opponent.</p>

		<div class="tertiary col">
			<h2>Zord</h2>
			<h3>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h3>
			<img class="feat-img" src="trexzord.jpg" alt="zord">
			<p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex zord forms the body and head of the megazord. It is the mightiest of all Dinozords. It does not combine with the Dragonzord Battle Mode. When on its own it can use its tail and jaws as weapons. It has the ability to fire energy blasts from its eyes. It can also roar so strongly that it creates seismic blasts, channeling the Earth as a weapon and vaporizing monsters. It can also stand on its tail and kick the opponent like a kangaroo. The Tyrannosaurus Rex remains underground when not in use.</p>
